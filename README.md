# LogoMeImpressed
 Greetings! I am a junior developer, here I created a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. 

## 🪄 User Story

**GIVEN** a command-line application that accepts user input

**WHEN** I am prompted for text

**THEN** I can enter up to three characters

**WHEN** I am prompted for the text color

**THEN** I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

**WHEN** I am prompted for a shape

**THEN** I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

**WHEN** I am prompted for the shape's color

**THEN** I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

**WHEN** I have entered input for all the prompts

**THEN** an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

**AND** the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

**WHEN** I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

**THEN** I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
